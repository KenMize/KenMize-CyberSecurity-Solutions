# Kenneth Mize's Cybersecurity Leadership Portfolio

## Introduction

Hello, and welcome to my personal cybersecurity portfolio! I'm Kenneth Mize, a Principal Security Architect with 15+ years of hands-on experience leading large-scale security transformations in the financial services and healthcare sectors. My expertise spans cloud-native security architectures (AWS, Azure), IAM frameworks, and vulnerability management. 

I specialize in building scalable, secure infrastructures that not only protect critical business assets but also enable innovation—because let's face it, the business needs security to move forward, not slow down. I’ve designed and deployed security frameworks that balance the rigorous demands of compliance (NIST, PCI DSS, HITRUST) with the fast-paced growth of dynamic organizations.

If you’re looking for someone who speaks fluent "business" to executives while also getting into the weeds with security teams, we’re on the same page. As a trusted advisor to C-suite executives, I’ve been able to translate complex technical risk into actionable business strategies, fostering collaboration, building high-performing teams, and driving security excellence.

## Why This Portfolio?

This repository is more than just a collection of documents—it's a reflection of my journey in leading cybersecurity teams and initiatives that have had measurable business impact. Whether it's reducing vulnerability remediation time by 80% or automating IAM processes to cut onboarding time by 85%, I’m proud to show you not only what I’ve built but the results it’s delivered.

Here, you’ll find:

- **Cloud Security Architecture**: How I’ve designed and deployed cloud-native security systems across AWS and Azure, ensuring compliance and resilience while minimizing risks.
- **IAM Solutions**: The unified Identity and Access Management systems that I’ve architected and automated, reducing human error and improving efficiency enterprise-wide.
- **Vulnerability Management**: My approach to vulnerability triage, patching, and remediation that resulted in improved risk posture and compliance.
- **Application Security**: The steps I’ve taken to overhaul application security programs, embedding security into the CI/CD pipeline and reducing vulnerabilities.
- **Compliance & Risk Management**: How I’ve helped organizations meet regulatory requirements while managing and mitigating risks efficiently.
- **Leadership**: My experience in mentoring teams, collaborating cross-functionally, and reporting to executives in a way that aligns with business goals.

## A Little Humor

Yes, I’m all about building robust security postures, but I also believe in making sure our teams can laugh together, celebrate wins, and tackle challenges with a good sense of humor. After all, if you're not enjoying the ride, why build secure cloud environments in the first place?

*“Security is like a lock on a door—it’s only as strong as the keyholder. Let’s make sure we’re the ones holding the keys to success!”*

I hope you find this as insightful and helpful as I do. If nothing else, you might learn a thing or two about how to secure the cloud, reduce vulnerabilities, and maybe even have a bit of fun along the way.

Cheers,
